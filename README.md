* **Technolgies Used:** Python, JavaScript, Django, React.
* **Other Api Used:** [open weather map](https://openweathermap.org/api)

## About:

The live version of this app is served on [heroku](https://fierce-shore-33391.herokuapp.com/) totally hosted as a full stack application, I pride myself on the fact that I was able to deploy this CRUD app without using CORS unlike all the tutorials from more experienced did.


## Usage:

The functionality of the app is pretty straight forward, you select a between to tabs, the WEATHER APP and the TODO APP tabs, the weather tab displays a 5 day forecast for nyc, the other is a fully functional todo app that persist the task even after leaving the page. 


The live version is hosted [here](https://fierce-shore-33391.herokuapp.com/), if need to run locally clone the current repository and run the following command:
 ```
    python manage.py runserver
    
  ```

Please note, to use the open weather map api need to sign up for an api key at their website.
